* Notes
1. Are there endogenous genes that are regulated by ribosome collisions?
   - /RQC1/ has a stretch of polyK residues that seem to function through a negative feedback loop citep:Brandman2012.
   - Decrease the initiation rate of ribosomes on /RQC1/ and show that it increases expression of /RQC1/.
   - Look for other stretches of polyK residues in yeast genome. This was done by citep:Brandman2012, look at their Table S4.
   - There are lot of ribosomal proteins in Table S4 of citep:Brandman2012. This suggests an interesting hypothesis that synthesis of translation-initiation components including the ribsomes is regulated through a negative-feedback based on translational quality control.
